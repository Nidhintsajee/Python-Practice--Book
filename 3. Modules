Problem 2: Write a program extcount.py to count number of files for each extension in the given directory. The program should
take a directory name as argument and print count and extension for each available file extension.

$ python extcount.py src/
14 py
4 txt
1 csv

Ans 2:
extcount.py:
from os.path import join, splitext
from glob import glob
from collections import Counter

path = r'/'

c = Counter([splitext(i)[1][1:] for i in glob(join(path, '*'))])
for ext, count in c.most_common():
    print ext, count

Problem 3: Write a program to list all the files in the given directory along with their length and last modification time. 
The output should contain one line for each file containing filename, length and modification date separated by tabs.

Hint: see help for os.stat.

Problem 4: Write a program to print directory tree. The program should take path of a directory as argument and print all the
files in it recursively as a tree.

$ python dirtree.py foo
foo
|-- a.txt
|-- b.txt
|-- code
|   |-- a.py
|   |-- b.py
|   |-- docs
|   |   |-- a.txt
|   |   \-- b.txt
|   \-- x.py
\-- z.txt

Ans 4:
#!/usr/bin/python
import os

# traverse root directory, and list directories as dirs and files as files
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("."):
    path = root.split('/')
    print((len(path) - 1) * '---', os.path.basename(root))
    for file in files:
        print(len(path) * '---', file)
